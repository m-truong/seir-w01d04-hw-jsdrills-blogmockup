#  W01D04 Prepare for the Next Day

## Classes, Prototypes, and The DOM

In tomorrow's morning lecture, we will discuss Classes and Prototypes. The afternoon lecture will be spent going over the DOM. You should've heard about and touched upon it a little during Fundamentals and pre-work, both being of great importance as the course progresses. If you are feeling up to doing some extra prep, we have attached some videos and resources you can look at!
