## Getting Started

This weekend's homework comes in **two required parts**: 

- [JS Function Drills](function_drills) 
- [Blog Mockup](blog_mockup)
- [Array Methods](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-Margaret/homework-w01d04/blob/master/array-methods-callbacks.md)

All three are required to have your assignment marked as complete, so make sure you attempt and work on **all** assignments.

We suggest you get started with the function drills first, next work on the Array methods and finally work on the mockup afterwards.

The instructions for both assignments can be found in their respective folders/files, linked above.

## Deliverables

- A `solutions.js` file inside of the function_drills folder with your attempts at solving the function drill problems and Array Methods problems.
